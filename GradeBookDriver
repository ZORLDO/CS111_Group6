/* Chapter No. 4 - Group Project
   File Name:          GradeBookDriver.java
   Programmer:         Michael Gray, Aaron Haitin, Jarred S, Jasdeep Sihota
   Date Last Modified: October 12, 2016

   Problem Statement: Create a Grade Book class that contains instance variables for the course name, number of credits, room #, and student capacity.    Create mutator/accessor (or commonly known as getter's/setter's) methods for each of the instance variables.
Create a driver program that creates a grade book and presents the user with a menu.
   
   
   Overall Plan:
   1. Create a GradeBook class with all necessary variables (see stylesheet on other file for info)
   2. Create a new gradebook
   3. Greet the user with a menu that lets you select using integers
   4. Declare all variables that the user might input
   5. Prompt the user for a variable called "input"
   6. Create a while loop with a switch inside of it
   7. Set corresponing cases to allow value assignments
   8. After each case, ask the user what they'd like to do next. Allow them to choose an option from the menu again.
