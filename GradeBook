   Problem Statement: Create a Grade Book class that contains instance variables for the course name, number of credits, room #, and student capacity.    Create mutator/accessor (or commonly known as getter's/setter's) methods for each of the instance variables.


   
   
   Overall Plan: 
   1. Create a new class called GradeBook
   2. Declare all private instance variables
   3. Create setters for course name, room number, credits, and capacity
   4. Create getters for course name, room number, credits, and capacity
   5. Create a printout method that displays all of the information assigned to the GradeBook
